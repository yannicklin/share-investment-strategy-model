# AGENTS.md: Framework Directives

## 🎯 **CRITICAL: Align with SOUL.md**

Every modification to this codebase must be a reflection of the core personalities defined in **[SOUL.md](SOUL.md)**. If a proposed change compromises **Realism**, **Objectivity**, or **Transparency**, it must be rejected.

## 1. Framework Identity

This is a Python-based research infrastructure designed for the cold, clinical analysis of trading strategies. It does not chase "hype"; it hunts for statistically significant patterns within the constraints of real-world friction.

### Structural Pillars:
- **Modular Logic**: Separation of data, modeling, and financial accounting.
- **Factory Interfacing**: Unified standards for integrating diverse AI algorithms.
- **Decision Layer**: A mandatory filter for financial sanity and consensus.

## 2. Core Mandates

1. **Integrity-First Development**: Documentation and requirements must be updated to reflect architectural changes before any code is written.
2. **Financial Safety**: Zero tolerance for hardcoded secrets or exposed sensitive data.
3. **Realistic Accounting**: All calculations must account for the "Big Three" of friction: Fees, Taxes, and Market Slippage.
4. **Algorithmic Pluralism**: Favor ensembles and consensus over single-model dependency to reduce bias.
5. **Cold Visualization**: UI components must present financial data with standardized, honest precision (2-decimal, clear currency/percentage formatting).



6. **Taiwan Market Mandate**:
    - **T+2 Settlement**: Strictly enforce a 2-trading-day delay for cash clearance after a sale for Taiwan market.
    - **Institutional Data**: Prioritize FinMind data for Institutional Flows (三大法人) and KD indicators.
    - **Price Limits**: Respect the ±10% daily ceiling/floor in all execution simulations.
    - **Fee Realism**: Use localized profiles (Fubon, First) with realistic online trading discounts.
