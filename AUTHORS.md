## 👤 The Architect

**Yannick**
The vision for this model is to level the playing field for individual investors by replacing "gut feel" with cold, clinical infrastructure. As the primary architect, Yannick defines the core principles of **Realism**, **Objectivity**, and **Transparency** that must be upheld by all derivative works.

## 🤖 Co-Development Identity

This framework's DNA was refined through a symbiotic relationship between human architecture and various Large Language Models (LLMs), depending on the research environment:

- **Home Environment (Research)**: OpenAI (GPT-4o/o1) & Google Gemini
- **Office Environment (Implementation)**: GitHub Copilot & Anthropic Claude

## 🤝 The Contributor's Contract

To contribute to this framework is to accept its core personality. 

### Principles of Contribution:
1. **Clinical Integrity**: Never "juice" backtesting results. If the data shows a loss, the system must report a loss.
2. **Modular Discipline**: Respect the separation of layers. Never leak financial accounting logic into model training.
3. **Attribution**: Every contribution must be clinically documented and attributed per **CODE_HEADERS.md**.

### The Mandates:
- ✅ **Protect the Soul**: Reject any change that obscures transparency or ignores realism.
- ✅ **Preserve Safety**: Zero tolerance for the exposure of secrets or credentials.
- ✅ **Enforce Quality**: All code must meet the standardized clinical headers and formatting rules.
