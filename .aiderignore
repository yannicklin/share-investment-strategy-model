# Aider Configuration for ASX AI Trading System

## 🎯 CRITICAL: Read SOUL.md Before Making Changes

**All AI agents MUST read SOUL.md first to understand:**
- Project philosophy and core values
- Architectural principles
- Security and financial safety standards
- Development journey and lessons learned
- Code attribution requirements

**Violating SOUL.md principles = rejected work.**

## Project Context

**Name**: ASX AI Trading Strategy System  
**Type**: Python/Streamlit Machine Learning Application  
**Purpose**: Multi-model AI trading strategy analysis with realistic backtesting

---

## Development Mandates

### 1. Documentation-First
- Update `asx_ai_trading_system_requirements.md` before coding
- Never implement without documentation updates

### 2. Backtesting Realism
- Include CMC Markets fees, ATO taxes, price gaps, T+1 settlement
- Never compromise realism for better-looking results

### 3. Multi-Model Consensus
- Maintain factory pattern with 5 algorithms
- Preserve majority vote consensus (≥3/5 models)
- Keep tie-breaker mechanism

### 4. Data Integrity
- Use `.AX` suffix for ASX tickers
- Use `auto_adjust=True` and `Close` column
- Implement RSI, MACD, Moving Averages

### 5. Security
- Never commit API keys
- Never make financial claims without disclaimers
- Always validate inputs
- Always test with real ASX data

### 6. Code Attribution
**All new Python files MUST include:**

## File Structure

- `core/` - Business logic (models, backtesting, configuration)
- `ui/` - Streamlit components (sidebar, views)
- Don't mix UI and business logic
